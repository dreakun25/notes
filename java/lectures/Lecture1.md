# Introduction

## Objects

- Divided in Classes
- Have paired keys and values
- Keys and values define state of object
- Can have Methods

## Class

- Has a schema
- Can have methods
- All instances share methods
- Subclasses inherit from parent
- To acces value add `.` after instance with the key (e.g. `Test.keyOne`)
- To access method add `.` with name of method (e.g. `Test.methodOne()`)

## Data

- Variable has to be created with type (int, char, float, etc) and then name
- Constants can be created with `final`
- String needs double quotes `"sample"`
- An instance of a class is created like this: `Test myTest = new Test();`

## Code

- Single line comments begin with `//`
- Multyline coments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`
- Import library statement `import`
- To use an object in a library we have to create a new instance of it
- To print on screen `System.out.println("message")`
- For length of characters in a `String` we use the `length()` method (e.g. `string.length()`)
- Concantination uses `+` (e.g. `"string one " + "string 2"`)
- Function without a return value is declared as `void`
- At the start of our code we need to declare a `main()` function so that the program can be executed
